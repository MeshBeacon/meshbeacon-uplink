/**
 * @file DuckRouter.h
 * @brief Internal CDP mesh routing table and network-state FSM.
 *
 * ## Routing table design
 *
 * The routing table is a hash map keyed on **destination device UID** (Duid).
 * Each key maps to a list of @ref Neighbor records — one per observed next-hop
 * path to that destination.  On every lookup the list is sorted by signal
 * quality (descending) and the best candidate is returned.
 *
 * ```
 * routingTable:
 *   "MAMA_A" -> [ Neighbor(nextHop=LINK_1, score=90, lastSeen=T),
 *                 Neighbor(nextHop=LINK_2, score=72, lastSeen=T-30s) ]
 *   "MAMA_B" -> [ Neighbor(nextHop=MAMA_A, score=85, lastSeen=T) ]
 *   ...
 * ```
 *
 * ## TTL-based eviction
 *
 * Entries are passively evicted on each call to @ref insertIntoRoutingTable.
 * Any @ref Neighbor record whose `lastSeen` timestamp is older than the
 * configured TTL (default 5 minutes / 300 000 ms) is removed.  When all
 * records for a destination are removed the destination key is also dropped,
 * keeping the table bounded without an artificial entry-count cap.
 *
 * ## Network-state FSM
 *
 * ```
 *  SEARCHING ──── network found ───► PUBLIC
 *  PUBLIC    ──── signal lost   ───► SEARCHING
 *  PUBLIC    ──── explicit disc ───► DISCONNECTED
 *  DISCONNECTED ─ retry         ───► SEARCHING
 * ```
 *
 * @date 2025-07-24 (created)
 * @date 2026-05-10 (TTL eviction enhancement)

         * `evictStaleEntries()` is called from @ref insertIntoRoutingTable on

         * a dedicated background thread or timer.
         *
         * ### Tuning the TTL
         * - Dense, high-traffic networks: lower TTL (e.g. 60 000 ms) to keep
         *   only recently active routes.
         * - Sparse or low-duty-cycle networks: raise TTL (e.g. 600 000 ms) to
         *   retain routes across long quiet periods.
         *
         * @param ttl_ms  Maximum age of a neighbor record in milliseconds.
         *                Default is 300 000 ms (5 minutes).
